# Velocity Prediction

This project is a Linear Regression-based model designed to predict the velocity in different stages of flight. The model utilizes various data parameters to make accurate predictions. 

## Data Parameters

The following data parameters are used in the model:

1. **Acceleration**: The rate of change of velocity over time, indicating how quickly the velocity is increasing or decreasing.

2. **TWR (Thrust-to-Weight Ratio)**: The ratio of thrust generated by the engine to the weight of the aircraft. It provides an indication of the aircraft's ability to accelerate.

3. **Altitude From Terrain**: The vertical distance between the aircraft and the ground. It helps determine the aircraft's height above the terrain.

4. **Downrange Distance**: The horizontal distance covered by the aircraft in the direction of its motion. It indicates the aircraft's progress along its flight path.

5. **Inclination**: The angle between the aircraft's flight path and the horizontal plane. It represents the tilt of the aircraft's trajectory.

6. **Vessel DeltaV**: The change in velocity that can be achieved by the spacecraft's propulsion system. It quantifies the spacecraft's ability to perform maneuvers.

7. **Apoapsis**: The point in an orbit where the spacecraft is farthest from the celestial body it is orbiting. It indicates the highest point in the spacecraft's trajectory.

8. **Pressure**: The force exerted by the surrounding fluid (e.g., air) on the aircraft. It helps determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft.

9. **G-Force**: The acceleration experienced by an object relative to free fall. It provides an indication of the gravitational forces acting on the aircraft.

## Model Performance

The model has achieved an impressive accuracy of 98.89%. Please note that the current dataset is relatively small, but continuous updates are being carried out to improve the model's performance. Additional data is being generated and tested to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

## Files

The project includes the following files:

- **VelocityModel1.ipynb**: This is the main file containing the code for the velocity prediction model. It is written in Jupyter Notebook format.

- **training.csv**: This file contains the training data used to train the model. It is in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format and serves as the primary input for the model training process.

Feel free to explore the code in the `VelocityModel1.ipynb` file and utilize the `training.csv` dataset for further analysis or improvements to the model.
