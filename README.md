# Velocity-Prediction-for-S2-33
The project is a Linear Regression based model created to predict the velocity of S2-33 Clydesdla Solid Fuel Booster the different stages of flight, using different data parameters such as : ["Acceleration","TWR","AltitudeFromTerrain","DownrangeDistance","Inclination","VesselDeltaV","Apoapsis","Pressure","GForce"]
